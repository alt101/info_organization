Questions:
What was the breakdown of the ranks of personnel that responded to each incident?  

Did the calls that required assistance from other counties have more responding personnel, compared to calls that did not require assistance?

Did “careers” or “volunteers” have a faster “enroute scene time” from dispatch time?
